# silly-cat-manages-hitboxes
Hello! this is a Roblox hitbox manager that uses magnitude to detect humanoid characters. I recently just made this as in October 7 2022, so there may be some bugs but please bear with me. This module uses [Janitor](https://github.com/howmanysmall/Janitor) and stravant's [Good Signal](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/lua-signal-class-comparison-optimal-goodsignal-class/1387063). The reason I made this module is because I couldn't find any magnitude hitbox modules, so here it is!
## What does this hitbox module include?
