# silly-cat-manages-hitboxes
Hello! this is a Roblox hitbox manager that uses magnitude to detect humanoid characters. I recently just made this as in October 7 2022, so there may be some bugs but please bear with me. This module uses [Janitor](https://github.com/howmanysmall/Janitor) and stravant's [Good Signal](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/lua-signal-class-comparison-optimal-goodsignal-class/1387063). The reason I made this module is because I couldn't find any magnitude hitbox modules, so here it is!
## What features does it include?
This is a DoD (data oriented design) based module and is very optimized, fast, and accurate. It also scans every humanoid character with a humanoid root part. If you wish to change how it behaves then you must change some stuff in the source code. 
## What are the limitaions of this hitbox manager?
- Hit only hits a humanoid target once.
- :Stop()
